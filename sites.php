<div class="website_description">
	Vibio is a social commerce site where users
	can share, buy, sell, and trade their items among their social circle. I'm currently the only
	engineer on a small team. This means I wrote all custom code (both back- and front- end) for the
	initial product release, as well as continuing to maintain the application and add new features.
	This was developed in just over three month's time using the Drupal 6 CMS and jQuery.

<div class="website_description">
	The website for TDU2 was developed, tested, and deployed to a live environment in a little over
	a week. This was accomplished by using two visual designers for front end HTML/CSS while I
	focused on leveraging the Atari Web Platform's Drupal 5 core (to which I had a large
	contribution) for getting necessary functionality, as well as adding small features as needed.
	After the release, I began working with Eden Games on using their Web Services portal to
	incorporate game data (such as user levels, data, club data, etc.) into the website.

<div class="website_description">
	On the Atari project I was responsible for importing existing content into the Drupal CMS and
	using Drupal taxonomy (categories) to control displays for game pages, game search results,
	and menus. I also converted the existing Atari front-end to a Drupal theme and created
	tools for managing custom content. I also helped in creating both front and back-end functionality
	for Atari's customer ticket support system.

<div class="website_description">
	On STO I wrote tools for internal users to manage customer facing marketing campaigns as well as
	the current site front end. I also interfaced with game data to display in-game data on the STO
	site.

<div class="website_description">
	For the CO site I wrote custom Drupal modules to interface with game guild, character, and
	customer support data. I also wrote the HTML/CSS/JS for the site's previous theme.
