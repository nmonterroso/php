<div class="website_description">
	Kismet is a mobile app that lets users share photos, chat, and see who's nearby. I'm currently
	the only engineer, so I'm responsible for writing both the Android front-end application
	and back-end web service.	The back-end service leverages Drupal 6 and the Services module.

<div class="website_description">
	TV Time is a mobile app that lets users subscribe to their favorite TV shows and
  notifies them at a configurable time when new episodes air. The aim is to let users
  "set it and forget it", and let TV Time do the hard work of keeping up with shows.
