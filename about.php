<h2 class="section_title">About Me</h2>
<p>
	Hi! My name is Nelson Monterroso. I was born in the Los Angeles, CA area, went to school in San Luis Obispo, CA where I received a B.S. in Computer Engineering.
	I currently live in South San Francisco and work in San Francisco as a Software Engineer.
</p>
<p>
	Since I started creating websites in the mid-90s on Geocities (back when your home URL was something like geocities.com/tokyo/garden/12345), I've been captivated
	by the web and its ability to reach and engage a virtually unlimited audience from a single source. This fascination combined with my strong sense of logic
	and my desire to create led me to pursue an education in computer engineering. Now, I specialize in web development using PHP and mobile development for Android.
</p>
<p>
	On the web, I'm a well-rounded developer able to create powerful user experiences on public facing interfaces using JavaScript/HTML/CSS, and efficient back end
	functionality using PHP. Whenever possible I leverage existing technologies to decrease development time and bugs in any project I participate in.
</p>
<p>
	In addition to being a developer, I also fancy myself a pretty avid gamer, enjoy watching movies, playing basketball, riding my bike, and ketchup on
	everything I eat.
